                        Mars, often called the “Red Planet,” is the fourth planet from the Sun and one of Earth’s closest neighbors in the solar system. It gets its reddish color from iron oxide, or rust, on its surface. Mars is smaller than Earth, with about half its diameter and only one-third of its gravity. A day on Mars, called a sol, is just over 24 hours, but a year lasts about 687 Earth days. The planet has thin air made mostly of carbon dioxide, making it impossible for humans to breathe without support. Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and a massive canyon, Valles Marineris, that dwarfs the Grand Canyon. It experiences seasons like Earth due to its tilted axis. Evidence shows that liquid water once flowed on Mars, and polar ice caps of water and carbon dioxide still exist today. Scientists believe Mars might have supported microbial life in the past. Robotic missions like NASA’s Perseverance and Curiosity rovers explore its surface, searching for signs of life and preparing for future human missions. Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are irregularly shaped and may be captured asteroids. Dust storms on Mars can cover the entire planet for weeks. Temperatures are extreme, ranging from a mild 20°C near the equator to –125°C near the poles. Its thin atmosphere provides little protection from harmful radiation. Mars is a key focus for space agencies as a possible second home for humans. Projects like SpaceX’s Starship aim to send humans there in the coming decades. Studying Mars helps scientists understand planetary evolution and the potential for life beyond Earth. Despite its challenges, Mars continues to inspire exploration and dreams of interplanetary travel.
